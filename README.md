# Cydia-Complete-Repo-List
Complete repo list for Cydia
DISCLAIMER: We are not responsible for anything that is hosted on these repos, or any damage caused by this list or packages installed from these repos.

Aimed to be the Most complete Repo list for Cydia. Has almost 200 repos, Cydia will load much slower and will likely take at least a few minutes to refresh. Recommended a device with at least an A6 cpu.

 Place cydiacompleterepo.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to install. If after killing cydia and reopening it the new repos don't show (don't need to refresh to see) then you may need to changes the permissions on the file. You can use iFile of Filza to do so.
